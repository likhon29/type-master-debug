                  <p class="card-text">The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time.sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block.Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.  
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.A global variable has Global Scope:All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.</p>
